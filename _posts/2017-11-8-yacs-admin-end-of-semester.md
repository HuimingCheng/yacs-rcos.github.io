The semester is almost over and so far I feel like I've made a lot of progress with YACS Admin. Coming into the semester,
I wasn't familiar with Angular or Jasmine at all. It took a while to learn, but at this point, I feel confident using Angular
and with the overall workflow. I think the refactor was a good idea. Personally, I've found the new build to be a lot less buggy
and easier to work with. Thanks to my mentor Katie, too. She really helped me with learning the new technologies and 
I was able to start making real contributions a lot sooner than expected. 

With all the components implemented, the next step is to integrate real data. I'm excited to see real people start using the admin 
system and I hope that this will be an improvement to YACS.
