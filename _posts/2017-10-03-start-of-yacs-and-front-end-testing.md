This will be my first semester in RCOS as well as YACS! I am excited in joining and hope to be a good addition to the team. I come in with a few years of experience working with networking protocols as well as having quite a bit of problem solving experience.

My goals for this semester is to contribute to the best of my ability first and foremost. In terms of YACS, I aim to implement the majority of the front-end unit tests for the new web-yacs project. Part of this will be to learn about JavaScript (combining Typescript, Jasmine, and Angular for the tests) - as I have never taken the journey into the lands of front-end development before.

Currently I am trying to implement my first test and I've started to get through the pains of dependencies and 'mocking' objects or at least trying to emulate that in JavaScript terms. Hopefully I will finish front-end testing before the semester ends and am able to start another project before then and most of all have fun!
