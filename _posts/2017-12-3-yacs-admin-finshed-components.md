Since my last post, I finished up the implementation of the section component. Using mock data everything displays correctly
in HTML and all the tests pass. This is the last component, so the YACS admin refactor is essentially complete. There is still some
formatting left to make the data look like all the other components and a few more tests, but that's about it. 

I have been having some issues with Git recently. My last merge messed up how my local repo stays updated but it shouldn't take too long to fix.
