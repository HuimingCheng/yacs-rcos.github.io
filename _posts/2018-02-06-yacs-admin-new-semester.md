This is my second semester working on YACS Admin. Hopefully, this semester we can implement a lot more features. 
Most importantly, getting everything working with real data and having a system that people can use and interact with. 
Since we aren't refactoring this time, I think we will be able to make a lot more progress. Also, I'm more familiar
with Angular so I won't have to spend as much time learning new technology. Should be another great semester!
