This semester I got a lot accomplished in regards to the YACs Web testing. In terms of progress with testing the repository, I finished testing all of the angular components! I have also started testing the services that are in Web YACs, but I most likely will not finish that in the time left in the semester. I created templates for all the service tests, so that should make them relatively easy to complete when resolved.

The components that I finished were AboutComponent, CourseComponent, SectionComponent, CourseListComponent, CourseViewComponent, FooterComponent, HeaderComponent, ScheduleViewComponent, SchoolListComponent, and currently I've completed the YacsService. The last tests left to complete are a few more throughout the components as well as creating tests for SelectionService and ConflictsService. If I don't finish those tests, they will be pasted on as TODOs for next semester. Because of all the other tests that I have completed, it could be a good learning exercise for new members.

I am pleased with what I have learned in Javascript and Typescript and specifically with what I've learned about Javascript testing with the Jasmine framework. Javascript was overall an unpleasant experience with all its oddities and all that, but learning how to Unit test with Jasmine made it definitely worth the challenges.
