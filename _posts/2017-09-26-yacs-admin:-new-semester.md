Last semester was a great learning experience, and even though the YACS admin kickoff was sloppier than I would have liked, it is returning for another semester!

I learned a lot regarding software engineering in my internship, including more about test-driven development and JavaScript. Hopefully my new skills will prove useful in this semester, and it looks like they should. In addition, the YACS admin project now has a new member, so I am no longer the sole maintainer of this project.

Goals for this semester: 

- Fully implement all unit tests
- Get unit tests working
- Use the new admin API in production
- Dockerize application
- Add authentication
- Add periods as a subset of sections
- Visualize periods
- Get application ready for production
- Upgrade to Rails 5 or 4.2.8

Right now, it looks like the first thing I should be taking care of is getting the unit tests working. Then, I can worry about authentication and periods. Upgrading the application to Rails 5 and Dockerizing the application will be the final step before getting the app ready for production, which should hopefully be done before the end of the semester.

This list is not exhaustive, as I am sure that new issues will pop up during the semester and I will think of more things to add to the application. Overall, I am looking forward to this semester and many more semesters (even though I only have two more semesters left here after this semester)!
