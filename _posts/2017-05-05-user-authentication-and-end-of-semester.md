As we approach the end of the semester, 
I am in the process of reviewing my contributions.
I worked on various kinds of test-driven development
during the course of the semester. For one, 
I had completed the implementations
of request specifications for courses, departments, sections, and schools.
This included update, create, and show functionalities for all
controllers, which allowed me to return and render responses for GET, PUT, and
POST requests. 
Towards the end of the semester, I implemented user authentication by 
introducing the usage of a token to validate all requests made
within the rspec unit tests, and I further migrated and generated a model
for token generation. While the user authentication tests remain in progress,
I plan to complete the implementation and continue developing
with YACS in the future.
