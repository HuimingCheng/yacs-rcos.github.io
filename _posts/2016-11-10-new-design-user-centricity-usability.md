User Centricity & Usability

YACS is primarily a service site. The wants, needs, and limitations of our end users are very important to us, and we strive to improve the sites performance, usability, and functionality to fit these needs. Our goal is to make all the functionality, current and upcoming, clearly available to our users.

As part of the New Design, we have been brainstorming ways of improving our site's User Experience. Our goal is to maintain a clear user flow, clear visibility, and high performance. Often, all the perks of a product aren't made abundantly clear, so we strive to build an experience that allows users to benefit from all of YACS functionality. Our aim is to direct our users all the value our site can add to their lives in subtle yet profound ways.

Naturally, as a user centered application, our users' opinions are very important to us. We have also released a [feedback survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1QTwZcoBkrcOMPT08UXr5O0Ik0S0s0r0-dyah0djLeg0/edit), and have shared it throughout a few Rensselaer facebook pages. By gathering feedback from dozens of students you have used YACS, we hope to design and implement new features that better aide the student body, and also enhance the present features. We know that extending functionality is great and often important, but we also value user research and observation. We want to see how our users are responding to the current application and how they will continue to respond in the future.

Further, as we hope to allow YACS to be used throughout many schools, we are working on creating very clean and easy to follow Documentation for the code base. We are in the process of creating a Static Site to house all this documentation, YACS information, Â updates, and a link to our repository.

We have come up with some great ideas regarding improved visibility for course listings and course sections listing, schedule view, and general site aesthetic, and we will be implementing these new layouts. We are also getting a lot of responses from our survey, and will be looking through every response carefully to summarize what our users want, and create issues for them in the GitHub repository. We hope to periodically send out surveys to fully gauge how YACS is performing for the end user.

We will post some Mock-Ups for the New Design on the blog very soon!
