YACS is, of course, designed to assist the students of a university make decisions. It follows that we emphasize a sleek, friendly user interface that not only serves a student user's needs, but allows for an easy to understand, appealing user flow.

There a 6 points we try to address in our UI:

User Centricity.

Usefulness and Value.

Functionality.

Reliability.

Usability.

Aesthetic Seduction.

As a future milestone, we are also addressing a very important element of User Centered design.

*Accessibility.Â *

More on each element and final Mock-ups in separate blog posts!
