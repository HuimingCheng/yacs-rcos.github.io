I finished the course list mobile implementation with the corresponding api calls for get section. On the first view I changed a few things aesthetically (mostly colors). Also the cells are grey, but now white to match the color scheme of the course list.

Currently the course list view is just a functional way to select courses. Things that will be changed in the course list view are :

1. Change each cell to have a better custom view ( currently it's a single text field with a single string) -> (Each section / seats / instructor will have it's own text field.)
2. Add a custom view to the section header ( currently it's a single line with the course name) ->( course name / code / a button to select all sections / a button to display information.)
