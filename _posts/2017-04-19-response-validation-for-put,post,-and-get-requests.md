Hi YACS! I recently completed and received approval for
my pull request titled "Admin API Response 
Validation for PUT/POST/GET Requests". I modified update and create
functionalities for courses, departments, schools, and sections
such that responses could be rendered and returned. I further
included JSON validation for courses, departments, schools and sections
within the request specifications for all four controllers.
