Aesthetic & Mock Ups:

Of course, with all that we are focusing on for the New Design of YACS and future updates to the design, we must keep in mind the Aesthetic of our site. YACS prides itself on its sleek appearance and easy to use interface. We want to maintain our brand and continue to put forth an excellent product without any overly complicated, distracting, and performance diminishing styling.

Simply put, we strive to present a *sexy*Â application.

Sexiness is not adding clunky animations, excessive color usage, style layering.

Sexiness is an application that solves our users' scheduling problems with an interface that is that is easy on the eyes. Things we are keeping in mind in terms of external appearance are the Rensselaer and RCOS brand ties, consistency in size, format, spacing, and alignment, and elegant color schemes. Further, since our site necessarily has many textual elements, and is an open source project, we want to use typographic elements for better readability, and use fully open source fonts!

Elements of accessibility also play into our aesthetic. We are want to appeal to a diverse user base by maintaining 508 Compliance. Thus means we meet color contrast thresholds and responsiveness to zooming and assistive browsers.

In this post, we are attaching the designs we are striving to implement. These designs are strictly related to course listings and individual course elements. After these are fully implemented, we will work on Schedule view mock-ups.
