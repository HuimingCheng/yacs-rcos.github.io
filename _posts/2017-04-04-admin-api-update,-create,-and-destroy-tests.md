Hi, YACS! I am Rutvik and I am a new contributor.
I recently completed and received approval for my
pull request titled "Admin API Create, Destroy, and Update Tests".
I tested POST, PUT, GET, and DELETE requests within
departments_spec.rb, sections_spec.rb, schools_spec.rb, 
and courses_spec.rb. I additionally wrote functions
to handle create, destroy, and update within courses_controller.rb, 
sections_controller.rb, department_controller.rb, and school_controller.rb.
Once the show function is modified, I can apply changes to all of these functions
to return  and check responses.
