As the semester comes to a close, things are looking good for Solr on YACS. Much of the Solr functionality from before YACS switched over to docker is now operational again. Once a proper solution for importing our custom solr schema during the docker build process is implemented, we will be just about ready to pull request in Solr, and hopefully have it implemented in the official YACS build before long. I am very excited to finalize Solr and move forward with other components of the YACS project in the future!
