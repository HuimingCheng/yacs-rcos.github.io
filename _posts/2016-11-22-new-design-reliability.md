Reliability:

YACS strives to maintain a reliable code base. On a smaller level, we are eager to constantly gain feedback about potential bugs and issues with performance, and promptly fix them or work on improving them. A very large portion of a sleek user experience is providing a reliable site.

There are areas we are trying to improve. Members of the YACS team are trying to build communications with administrators and instructors in order to ensure accurate data. In our road map is better channels for this process.

We also want to continue to send our surveys to our users and follow through with issue resolution!

As we have plans to expand YACS beyond Rensselear, we are eager to set a precedent for how student and faculty interact with their school catalog.
