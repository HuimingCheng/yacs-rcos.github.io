YACS Admin is returning for its third semester!

This semester is starting out much more smoothly than my previous two semesters on the project thanks to careful test-driven development last semester and establishing a rudimentary plan for this semester beforehand.
 
In addition, we will be working in sprints and will be using project boards and milestones for better project management. Our first sprint started on Tuesday and will end next Tuesday. We didn't really get much done last week, and we should take this into consideration next semester by making the first sprint longer to allow for ramp-up.

Other than that, the project board is already working well, and we can track which issues haven't been started, are in progress, are awaiting review, and done.

Our first milestone will be completing everything we didn't finish last semester, and our next two milestones will be implementing search and pagination, respectively. The latter two milestones do not necessarily have to be done in order, since these are two entirely different features.

Looking forward to a productive (albeit very busy) semester!
