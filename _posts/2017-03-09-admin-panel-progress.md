Hello again!

Last time I blogged, progress was *very* rocky. But in only about a week, I made a lot of progress on the admin panel.

By Sunday, I had an index page for schools, departments, courses, and sections. By Tuesday, I had index, show, and search implemented. On Wednesday, I also did numerous frontend improvements. You can check out the admin panel repository [here](http://github.com/kburk1997/yacs-admin).

Below are a few screenshots of the admin panel in action!

Note that the add/edit/delete links do not actually do anything as of now, since those operations are not on the YACS APIÂ yet.

I still have a long way to go before fully implementing authentication and CRUD operations, but I am very happy about the progress I've made, especially when the first 5-6 weeks have been very rocky.
