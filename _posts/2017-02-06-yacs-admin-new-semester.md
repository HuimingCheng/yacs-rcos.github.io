This is my second semester working on YACS Admin. Hopefully, this semester we can implement a lot more features. Most importantly, getting everything working with real data and having a system that people can use and interact with. Since we aren\'92t refactoring this time, I think we will be able to make a lot more progress. Also, I\'92m more familiar with Angular so I won\'92t have to spend as much time learning new technology. Should be another great semester!}
