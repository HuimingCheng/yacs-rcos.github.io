Functionality, Usefulness, and Value:

As far as current and upcoming design goals, the functionality and usefulness YACS can provide to the user is by far the most important.

In the realm of design, we care a lot about ease of use and an attractive site definitely has its perks, but these elements are simply there to contribute to usefulness. When it comes to our product, our overarching incentive is to provide an application that makes students' lives easier. All our design motives are aimed to fit the needs of all those who use YACS. Often, all the benefits of a product aren't made abundantly clear, so we strive to build an experience that allows users full advantage of YACS' functionality.

We have been actively expanding our knowledge and understanding of our user through design research and User Feedback. As mentioned in a previous post, we have also released a user research survey to gain feedback from students who use YACS. We are gaining recommendations from our user base on how to further serve their needs. Through research, we are also able to see the limitations and potential features our site could release.

There are goals we want to achieve in terms of adding value to our users' lives. We want to saves them time, creatively assist in course planning, allow exporting of course schedules.

Of course, as our primary product is scheduling software, we have been working towards improving functionality related to this. We have added course conflicts to block off conflicting courses.

Our future goals include: expandable course elements, allowing easy select all or specific select capabilities, conflict compare and swapping, enhanced search capabilities, potentially even scheduling directives for specific majors, schedule swapping, blocking off time slots during the week and forming conflicts with blocked times.

Further, as we hope to expand YACS beyond Rensselaer, we are analyzing potential milestones for compatibility, ease of export, ease of set up, and clear documentation.

We have a static information page in the works to make all our project information, code export and documentation, and blogging capabilities organized in a central location!

We are really excited about the feedback we have been receiving and eager to keep improving our site!
